## Project1 - Image Viewer

A simple image viewer with a detail page.

Learned the basics of iOS app development and got familiar with several fundamental concepts:

- Table views and UIImage
- FileManager
- Typecasting
- View controllers
- Outlets
- Auto Layout
- Also implemented UserDefaults, so now it tracks and displays the number of times each image has been opened
