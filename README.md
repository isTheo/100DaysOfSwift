# 100DaysOfSwift

This repository contains all the projects from Paul Hudson's 100 Days Of Swift(UIKit) course.  
*Built for iOS 17 with Xcode 15.*      
    
        
## Project 1 - Storm Viewer

Creating a simple image viewer with a detail page.

- Working with ```FileManager```
- Loading resources from Storage (```Bundle```)
- Creating ```TableViews``` and ```TableViewCells``` in Storyboards
- Simple Navigation

For this project the challenges were:

- Use Interface Builder to select the text label inside the table view cell and adjust its font size to something larger
- In the main table view, show the image names in sorted order, so “nssl0033.jpg” comes before “nssl0034.jpg”
- Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show “Picture X of Y”, where Y is the total number of images and X is the selected picture’s position in the array. Make sure you count from 1 rather than 0.
- Add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people
